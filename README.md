# Library-Management-System-FR-
This was my first programming project. It was written in the C language.  
It starts with a main menu and you can choose whether to manage book loans or to manage library.
  <h3> Upon choosing the 1st menu, you can: </h3>
   <ul> <li> Display Library Books </li>
    <li>Enter a Loan </li>
    <li>Delete a Loan </li>
    <li>Consult Loans Related to a Member </li>
   </ul>
  <h3> Upon choosing the 2nd menu, you can : </h3>
    <ul><li> Add a book and how number of available copies. </li>
    <li>Delete a book. </li>
    <li> Show which and how many books are available. </li>
    <li> Show which and how many books are loaned on a certain date </li>
    <li> Delete registered loans </li>
    <li> Show most wanted books </li>
    <li> Show most loyal customers </li>
