# Library-Management-System-FR-
This was my first programming project. It was written in the C language.  
It starts with a main menu and you can choose whether to manage book loans or to manage library.
  Upon choosing the 1st menu, you cann:
    * Display Library Books
    * Enter a Loan
    * Delete a Loan
    * Consult Loans Related to a Member

  upon choosing the 2nd menu, you can : 
    * Add a book and how number of available copies.
    * Delete a book.
    * Show which and how many books are available.
    * Show which and how many books are loaned on a certain date
    * Delete registered loans
    * Show most wanted books 
    * Show most loyal customers
